Tuesday:
Constructors were not quite as difficult as I thought they would be.  102 probably helped plant the seed plus sam's demos really helped build step by step.  Took a while to get my Table working.  Dale helped me and Ryan work through it. partway through his help I realized I hadn't added my script tag because we didn't need it yesterday.
- Constructors
- Tables
